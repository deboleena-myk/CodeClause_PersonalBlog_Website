            <p>Before electronic computers, there were human and mechanical computers and before those, clockwork devices. Many clockwork devices were so intricate that they could be "programmed" to complete a series of complex tasks, such as dancing or writing. Clockwork devices are probably the first known examples of "programming". The earliest known example is the Antikythera mechanism (200 BC - 70 BC). Ada Lovelace is known as the first computer programmer. In 1843, she had described an algorithm to compute Berboulli into Analytical Engine through punch cards. 1941, Konrad Zuse became the first person to program an electrical computer, the computer was actually able to perform the operation. In 1952 - American computer scientist, Grace Hopper, developed a system that could convert plain English into computer code. This would later become COBOL, a computer language still widely used today for data processing.
